# Advanced-Topics-In-Data-Science

## Course Description

This course covers popular advanced machine learning and deep learning concepts including recommendation systems (RS) and Deep RS, Bayesian networks, probabilistic graphical models, natural language processing (NLP), LSTM neural networks, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and advanced computer vision (Unet). Students complete individual comprehensive projects in one of the topic areas and present their findings in a seminar format.

### Why you should know this

All of the models and algorithms learning in this course, are extensively use them. Also, students will choose one topic they like the most and dive deeper into it while learn all other topics from classes and classmates

## Prerequisites:  

- [DS 2.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/DS-2.2-Deep-Learning)


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to ...

1. Describe the Recommender System (RS) and the various methodologies in RS
1. Understand all components in NLP, including Bag-of-Word, TFIDF, Topic Modeling, Word2Vec
1. Learn, build, and gain inference from a probabilistic graphical model
1. Generate computer images from GANs
1. Apply PageRank on a defined Network in order to find the influencer

## Class Assignments

### Seminars

You will complete individual comprehensive projects in one of the topic areas from class and present your findings in a seminar format.

**For Seminar 1:**

**1-** Each student will pick a topic of their interest about advanced DS topics:

**2-** Each student will study and explore that chosen DS topic and teach their understanding to the whole class by answering the following questions in their seminar:

- What is the problem?
- What is the model used to solve the problem?
- What is the data-set?
- How do you transform the data in order to be appropriate for the model?

**For Seminar 2:**

**3-** Implemente your chosen topic from Seminar 1 by doing one of the following:

- Making the existing model better

**OR**

- Compare the chosen methodology with another way of tackling the problem

For either option, you will present your findings to the class.

### Projects

You will complete individual comprehensive projects in one of the topic areas from class.

You will work on the Seminar 1 topic to make it your own Final Project which will be a part of your DS portfolio.
