# DS 2.4: Advanced-Topics-In-Data-Science

## Course Description

This course covers popular advanced machine learning and deep learning concepts including Recommender Systems (RS) and Deep RS, Bayesian networks, Probabilistic Graphical Models, Natural Language Processing (NLP), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and advanced computer vision techniques such as U-Nets. Students will complete individual comprehensive projects in one of these topic areas and present their findings to the class in a seminar format.
